# Hippohonk API
The Hippohonk API allows you to search for bands that are performing in local Austin music festivals, as well as information and 0-5 recommendation about how excited our reviewers are about seeing that band live.

So glad you asked!

- 1: I will leave the venue if this band comes on stage. No matter what, I’m gone.

- 3: I won’t leave the venue but I also won’t go out of my way to see this band.
- 4: I want to see this band and will try my best to fit them into my schedule.
- 5: I will go out of my way to see this band. I must see them.
