# Hippohonk API
The Hippohonk API provides access to festival band data, including location, genre, and reviewer ratings. The ratings are subjective and reflect how excited our reviewers are to see a band live.

### Rating Scale (1-5)

- `1`: I would leave the venue if this band comes on stage.
- `2`: I would only stay if a good band is coming up at this venue soon after they’re done.
- `3`: I won’t leave the venue but I also won’t go out of my way to see this band.
- `4`: I want to see this band and will try my best to fit them into my schedule.
- `5`: I must see this band and I would go out of my way to see them.

## Getting Started
The Hippohonk API provides programmatic access to festival band data. You can retrieve festival information and create new records using standard HTTP requests.

### Base URL

`https://hippohonk-api-642586320677.herokuapp.com/`

All examples below assume this base URL.

### Get all bands in a lineup
A _lineup_ represents all bands associated with a specific _festival_. Complete the following to retrieve a list of bands for a specific lineup:

1. Retrieve a list of all festivals, ordered by date

    <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="curl" label="curl">
    ```bash
        curl "/festivals"
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    ```python 
            import requests

            BASE_URL = ""
            

            response = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/festivals")

            print(response.status_code)
            print(response.json())
            ```
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    ---

    The API returns a JSON list with all festivals. Select the festival ID you'd like to query from this list.

    ```json
    {
            "id": 16,
            "name": "SXSW 2023",
            "date": "2023-03-13",
            "slug": "sxsw-2023",
            "createdAt": "2023-02-14T19:21:06.660Z",
            "updatedAt": "2023-02-14T19:21:06.660Z"
        },
        {
            "id": 15,
            "name": "SXSW 2020",
            "date": "2020-03-16",
            "slug": "sxsw-2020",
            "createdAt": "2020-01-15T15:13:20.238Z",
            "updatedAt": "2020-01-15T15:13:20.238Z"
        },
        {
            "id": 14,
            "name": "SXSW 2019",
            "date": "2019-03-11",
            "slug": "sxsw-2019",
            "createdAt": "2019-01-13T16:44:17.595Z",
            "updatedAt": "2019-01-13T16:44:17.595Z"
        },
        ```

1. Using the [`lineups` API](/api/lineups), retrieve the list of bands. This example uses `SXSW 2023`, with a `festival_id` of `16`.

    <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="curl" label="curl">
    ```bash
        curl "/lineups/16"
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    ```python 
            import requests

            BASE_URL = ""
            

            response = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/lineups/16")

            print(response.status_code)
            print(response.json())
            ```
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    This will give you all of the information about the bands performing in this lineup.

    ```json
    [
        {
            "id": 4373,
